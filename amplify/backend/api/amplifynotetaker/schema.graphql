# The auth directive here will give our appsync application personalized authorization to their data. 
# Therefore, when a new user authorizes themselves and logs in, they won't be authorized to see note data from other authorized users. 
# Even though we didn't declare an owner field for our note type in our dynamo db table, we'll still get an auto-populated field owner 
# in our dynamo db table that we can look at in the AWS console.
